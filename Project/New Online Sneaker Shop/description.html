  <p>A fresh new online shop has finally opened its gates for limited edition sneaker releases. HTTP requests arrive with a random recurrence rates during a sneaker release and the site manages to handles only a limited number of requests at the same time. Moreover, if the site has reached its maximum capacity of visitors per time, new clients enter a queue. Clients in a queue may grow impatient and hang up the queue without placing an order.
    Then customers, in order to buy their dream pair of shoes, have to select the size and add them to the cart. If the requested size isn't available, customers are able to queue one more time and request a different size. Finally, if the sneakers are available, customers are able to complete the order. \\
    Since sneaker drops are always used as a stress test for a site, the shop manager asked to keep track of the following key parameter indicator:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Number of lost orders,</li>
    <li>Number of total checkouts,</li>
    <li>AVG. queue length,</li>
    <li>Number of lost orders for size unavailable.</li>
  </ul>
